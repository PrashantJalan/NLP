1		41		there are two triangles and two squares here 
42		105		there is an inner square and an outer square 
236		250		
251		268		and out again 
269		275		
544		598		now their vertices have touched 
1		11		
12		33		there are two triangles in the box 
34		65		one is small one is slightly bigger 
549		563		and they are playing around 
564		598		
1		26		there are two triangles 
27		84		and both of them are trying to align themselves to their vertices 
232		267		and it attaches to another vertex 
325		351		then it is pushing the smaller one out 
568		590		circling around each other 
591		598		
1		50		
51		57		here we can see that 
58		102		two triangles one small and one big are playing in an arena 
229		251		smaller one is refusing to do so 
302		349		but the smaller one does not agree 
496		509		area outside the arena 
1		22		
23		47		we can see two triangles over here 
48		85		both are playing with each other inside the box 
86		95		
96		104		now 
133		155		the small triangle is roaming around 
237		246		
538		579		now both the triangles stay outside 
580		598		
1		10		
11		27		there are two triangles 
28		54		the bigger red one the smaller blue one 
55		61		
130		154		
251		265		
299		331		may be go outside the box 
539		562		both the triangle are outside the box 
563		584		
585		598		the bigger triangle is forcing 
1		16		
17		41		there is a big object and a small object 
42		80		both are fighting to stay in a big box 
81		109		which is sort of ring 
236		255		and comes out of the box 
561		576		both are fighting 
577		598		
1		43		so there is a red object and there is blue smaller object 
44		75		they both are fighting to remain in a box 
324		338		
495		514		taunt the red object 
549		598		and they both are fighting so that
