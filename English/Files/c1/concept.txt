24		71		this structure has a bigger rectangle and a smaller rectangle 
72		91		which has two triangles enclosed 
562		598		and then larger rectangle 
27		45		there is an open box 
46		67		their tips are touching and 
68		83		the triangles are rotating 
84		107		with respect to each other 
206		216		but it is not coming out 
248		283		it is not even letting the bigger triangle to move out of the box 
559		585		they are connected to each other 
586		598		
29		63		there are two triangles inside the box 
64		78		
79		119		the triangles are touching each other and rotating 
139		166		the smaller triangle is moving around 
42		105		there is an inner square and an outer square 
236		250		
251		268		and out again 
269		275		
12		33		there are two triangles in the box 
34		65		one is small one is slightly bigger 
66		114		both of them are trying to push each other 
139		168		the bigger triangle is now outside the box 
549		563		and they are playing around 
564		598		
27		84		and both of them are trying to align themselves to their vertices 
325		351		then it is pushing the smaller one out 
416		425		
568		590		circling around each other 
591		598		
51		57		here we can see that 
58		102		two triangles one small and one big are playing in an arena 
302		349		but the smaller one does not agree 
23		47		we can see two triangles over here 
48		85		both are playing with each other inside the box 
86		95		
96		104		now 
237		246		
580		598		
11		27		there are two triangles 
28		54		the bigger red one the smaller blue one 
55		61		
251		265		
498		520		the smaller one is roaming outside 
563		584		
585		598		the bigger triangle is forcing 
17		41		there is a big object and a small object 
42		80		both are fighting to stay in a big box 
81		109		which is sort of ring 
236		255		and comes out of the box 
316		366		the big object is trying to move out the small object 
561		576		both are fighting 
577		598
