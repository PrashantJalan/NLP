19		50		these are basically two triangles 
51		67		which are in a boundary
68		117		seems like the bigger red triangle is trying to push 
118		150		the smaller blue triangle out of the boundary
151		163		
164		200		right now the red triangle is outside the boundary itself
201		240		and it is trying to do something
241		280		so that it can push the blue triangle outside the boundary
281		353		rather it has come behind the blue triangle 
354		402		and it is pushing it back through the boundary
403		469		so it is quite successful butnow it has blocked its path
470		510		so that it cannot re enter
511		573		the blue triangle is around so that it can
574		598

15		68		i can see a rectangle with little two triangles
69		120		and right now there are two triangle inside
121		162		and they are attached by vertex and
163		198		the red triangle is outside
199		231		which is bigger and of red color
232		254		now it is again inside
255		288		now the small triangle is trying to
289		317		stretch his one of the vertex
318		345		
346		384		red triangle is pushing the smaller triangle outside
385		411		the smaller triangle is of blue color
412		440		
441		495		seems like the red triangle is stuck at the door
496		537		the blue triangle is outside
538		572		the red triangle is outside the door
573		598		and now they both are
599		616		attached by
617		634		
635		661		vertex and rotating
1		43		so there is a red object and there is blue smaller object
44		75		they both are fighting to remain in a box
76		118		and they both want to remain in the box
119		136		
137		171		the red object tries to 
172		207		turn the blue object by moving outside the box
208		244		so that the blue object follows him
245		282		but this strategy does not work for him
283		323		so he tries to move up
324		338		
339		377		drag out push out the blue object
378		429		using the virtue of his size
430		440		
441		476		and now the blue object is trying to 
477		494		
495		514		taunt the red object
515		548		and they both are now outside the box
549		598		and they both are fighting so that 
599		626		the first one can go in the box

19		50		these are basically two triangles 
51		67		which are in a boundary
68		117		seems like the bigger red triangle is trying to push

11		27		there are two triangles
28		54		the bigger red one the smaller blue one
55		61		
62		129		the red one is making the smaller one move in specific ways
130		154		
155		177		now the bigger one has gone outside
178		190		
191		210		he is inside again
211		250		it is trying to corner the smaller one
251		265		
266		298		into doing some specific things
299		331		may be go outside the box
332		377		it is pushing the smaller triangle outside the box
378		395		
396		425		and from their tips 
426		437		
438		497		it can force the smaller one more easily
498		520		the smaller one is roaming outside
521		538		
539		562		both the triangle are outside the box
563		584		
585		598		the bigger triangle is forcing
