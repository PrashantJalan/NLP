1		41		there are two triangles and two squares here
42		105		there is an inner square and an outer square
106		154		the side of the inner square is cut
155		205		the bigger triangle is out of the inner square now
206		235		and it is coming again
236		250		
251		268		and out again
269		275		
276		347		the bigger triangle is trying to push the 
348		389		smaller triangle out of the inner square
390		437		and it has pushed it outside
438		469		
470		483		now the smaller triangle is outside
484		534		and the bigger triangle is also outside now
535		543		
544		598		now their vertices have touched
1		11		
12		33		there are two triangles in the box
34		65		one is small one is slightly bigger
66		114		both of them are trying to push each other
115		138		
139		168		the bigger triangle is now outside the box 
169		194		and the smaller triangle is still inside
195		217		
218		241		the bigger triangle now came inside 
242		316		the smaller triangle is trying to push it outside the box
317		373		now the bigger triangle is trying to push the smaller triangle outside the box
374		412		
413		468		the smaller triangle is outside the box and the bigger triangle is still inside the box
469		519		
520		548		both of the triangles are outside the box
549		563		and they are playing around
564		598		
1		26		there are two triangles
27		84		and both of them are trying to align themselves to their vertices
85		123		they are in a semi closed box
124		185		and now one of the bigger triangle has gone outside
186		210		and it is trying to come back in
211		231		it comes back in 
232		267		and it attaches to another vertex
268		324		and then it has again gone out and trying to come back in
325		351		then it is pushing the smaller one out
352		391		and it has pushed the smaller one out
392		415		the smaller one has again come inside
416		425		
426		456		and gone outside completely 
457		490		and now the smaller one is roaming outside
491		526		and now the bigger one goes outside
527		567		and they are again interacting and 
568		590		circling around each other
591		598		
1		50		
51		57		here we can see that
58		102		two triangles one small and one big are playing in an arena
103		130		they are confined within a space
131		182		so now the bigger one comes out
183		228		and he is trying to call the smaller one out
229		251		smaller one is refusing to do so
252		301		so finally he is trying his best
302		349		but the smaller one does not agree 
350		386		so he is trying to push him outside the arena
387		428		and now the smaller one comes out
429		454		he is trying to explore
455		495		
496		509		area outside the arena
510		598		and after exploring they both started playing outside and enjoying
1		22		
23		47		we can see two triangles over here
48		85		both are playing with each other inside the box
86		95		
96		104		now
105		120		 
121		132		they are roaming
133		155		the small triangle is roaming around
156		178		the bigger triangle goes out
179		188		
189		236		and tries to pull the smaller triangle outside
237		246		
247		292		and the still the smaller triangle is inside the box
293		361		and he tries to push the smaller triangle outside again
362		371		
372		437		and he gets success in pushing him out
438		479		the smaller triangle tries to roam around outside
480		493		
494		537		and get acquainted with the surroundings over there
538		579		now both the triangles stay outside
580		598		
1		10		
11		27		there are two triangles
28		54		the bigger red one the smaller blue one
55		61		
62		129		the red one is making the smaller one move in specific ways
130		154		
155		177		now the bigger one has gone outside
178		190		
191		210		he is inside again
211		250		it is trying to corner the smaller one
251		265		
266		298		into doing some specific things
299		331		may be go outside the box
332		377		it is pushing the smaller triangle outside the box
378		395		
396		425		and from their tips 
426		437		
438		497		it can force the smaller one more easily
498		520		the smaller one is roaming outside
521		538		
539		562		both the triangle are outside the box
563		584		
585		598		the bigger triangle is forcing
1		16		
17		41		there is a big object and a small object
42		80		both are fighting to stay in a big box
81		109		which is sort of ring
110		158		and this is a game which they are playing
159		235		the big object moves out so that the small object follows it
236		255		and comes out of the box
256		315		but now basically both are fighting
316		366		the big object is trying to move out the small object
367		392		so that it can win
393		416		
417		437		the big object blocks the small object 
438		491		so that it cannot enter into the big box ring basically
492		520		the small object tries to 
521		560		
561		576		both are fighting
577		598		
1		43		so there is a red object and there is blue smaller object
44		75		they both are fighting to remain in a box
76		118		and they both want to remain in the box
119		136		
137		171		the red object tries to 
172		207		turn the blue object by moving outside the box
208		244		so that the blue object follows him
245		282		but this strategy does not work for him
283		323		so he tries to move up
324		338		
339		377		drag out push out the blue object
378		429		using the virtue of his size
430		440		
441		476		and now the blue object is trying to 
477		494		
495		514		taunt the red object
515		548		and they both are now outside the box
549		598		and they both are fighting so that
